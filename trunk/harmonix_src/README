This code runs the 'harmonix' digital instrument. It's not been extensively tested, as the project was never fully completed, due to difficulties with the hardware.
Most of the drivers, however, do work.  They were developed in earlier labs, and fully tested. 
This source code was written for the Motorola 8211.
