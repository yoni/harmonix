I think the best way to implement the key interface is by using a matrix circuit to use as few wires as possible. So the question we need to answer is how many keys are we going to have on the instrument?

Some things for now that i would like this instrument to have is two speakers(stereo) and an output jack to hook up to an amp.

Having MIDI might be a challenge but we first must look at specifications to see if it is feasible.
